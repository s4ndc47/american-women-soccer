			<p class="g-pstyle0">The National Women&rsquo;s Soccer League (NWSL) has cemented itself as one of the most competitive and celebrated women&rsquo;s football leagues in the world. In recent years, its popularity has even surpassed that of its male domestic counterpart, Major League Soccer (MLS). The 2024 NWSL Championship game between Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit drew over 1 million viewers (967,900 on CBS alone, with additional unreported figures from Paramount+). This marked an 18% increase from the 2023 final and a 6% rise compared to the 2022 finale.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle0">In contrast, MLS has faced challenges in gaining similar traction, partly due to limited television availability. This season, the league's marquee matchup between Columbus Crew and Inter Miami averaged just 157,000 viewers across FS1 and FOX Deportes combined.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle0">The NWSL is more than just a domestic competition; it&rsquo;s a proving ground for champions. Numerous World Cup winners have graced its pitches during off-seasons while lifting trophies on the international stage. Additionally, some of the most valuable players in European leagues&mdash;such as England&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Super League, Spain&rsquo;s Liga F, and France&rsquo;s Premi√®re Ligue&mdash;began their professional journeys in the NWSL. Stars like Lindsey Horan, Emily Fox, and Vanessa Gilles owe their formative development to the league.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle0">Despite its recent successes, the NWSL&rsquo;s journey has been anything but smooth. The league has weathered its share of ups and downs, including disbandment and revival. Below is a brief history of women&rsquo;s football in the United States, charting the evolution that brought the NWSL to where it stands today.</p>
